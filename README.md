II.  PROBLEM AND SOLUTION
Problem
* Lack of Efficient Developed Technologies – given the current status of the market, no company has mastered the implementation of an efficient and flexible tool for the skillset development of Youth sports, capable with today's technology. 

* Overall Market Cost-Inefficiency – while there is nothing like what Wraith AI is building currently on the market, our limited-in scope competition has gradually raised the cost of fees for their outdated services to exorbitant amounts, creating a vacuum of need for a more rational, and cost-efficient, business model.
 
* Poor and Insufficient Athlete Development Tools –  exists to support the ever-growing Youth Sports industry. Many needs are scattered across numerous antiquated apps and methods, creating feverish demand for some functional information and platform consolidation. 


Solution

* Utilize the most current technologies in constructing an AI-powered skillset development tool, with the dynamic flexibility to provide next-level instructions to young aspiring athletes.

* Offer more dynamic and faster information accessibility with greater overall app functionality to the user. Provide more reasonable subscription fees, with futuristic in-app features, seamless advertising options and powered by artificial intelligence.

* Widen the scope of the app’s AI athlete personalities to house more virtual sports assistants in currently several untapped, or underdeveloped niches. Manifest our futuristic model for creating app users' supreme digital utopia of sports-related training/instruction, progress tracking, nutrition, goal setting, mental preparation and information-sharing by strategically releasing new athletes, features and functionality currently planned and/or under development.
